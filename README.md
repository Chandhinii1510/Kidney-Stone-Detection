# Kidney-Stone-Detection

About Data
Chronic kidney disease is the Longstanding disease of the kidneys leading to renal failure.

The kidneys filter waste and excess fluid from the blood. As kidneys fail, waste builds up. Symptoms develop slowly and aren't specific to the disease. Some people have no symptoms at all and are diagnosed by a lab test. Medication helps manage symptoms. In later stages, filtering the blood with a machine (dialysis) or a transplant may be required
